## Running the wallet

This software does not need to be installed.

You just need to download the appropriate Windows or Linux(Beta) version, uncompress the arquive and run it from the folder.

## Building from source

To build from source you'll need a working installation of [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads) and the following packages:

- Indy 10
- DCPCrypt
- HashLib4PascalPackage
- SimpleBaseLib4PascalPackage
- CryptoLib4PascalPackage
- LazBarcodes

These packages are included in a folder called `Pacakges` located from the root of the repository. This is provided for convinience of the GitHub builds and may not always contain the latest version of these packages.

The best way to ensure that these packages are the latest version is to install them from the [Online Package Manager](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Online_Package_Manager)(OPM).
